# NBA Zone
This is a web application that provides users with an intuitive interface to explore, search, and analyze NBA player statistics.

# Backend Implementation Overview

This backend is implemented using **Java Spring Boot** and utilizes a RESTful architecture to serve NBA player statistics. 

## Tech Stack
- **Spring Boot (Java)**‚Äì REST API framework for serving player data.
- **Spring Data JPA + Hibernate** ‚Äì Handles ORM and interacts with a PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Primary relational database used to store player statistics.
- **JPA Repositories** ‚Äì Enable clean and abstracted data access via `PlayerRepository`.

# Features

- **Dynamic Query Handling**
Refactored controller logic to support all 31 possible combinations of up to 5 search filters (`playerName`, `teamName`, `college`, `country`, `season`) using a single service method.

- **Custom JPQL Queries for Performance**
Migrated filtering logic from in-memory stream operations to a custom `PlayerRepository` using JPQL dynamic query generation for more efficient and scalable searches across large datasets.

- **Entity Mapping & Schema Design**
The `Player` entity maps directly to the `player_stats` table, with clear mappings for fields like player name, team abbreviation, physical attributes, college, draft stats, and advanced metrics.

- **CRUD Operations**
Provides endpoints for Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions on player records.
